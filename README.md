Rules For Hooks

* Only use Hooks at the top level
* Dont call hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions

* Only call hooks from react functions
* Call them from within react functional Components and not just only regular javascript function  

UseEffect

* This Hook will let you perform sideeffect in functional components
* This is a close replacement to component DidMount, componennt DidUpdate, component WillUnmount
